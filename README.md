# SQL
This repository showcases my proficiency in SQL Server through various scripts and projects. It demonstrates my ability to:

***- Utilize Core Functionality:***

Queries and Function script demonstrates the utilization of core SQL functionality.

+ Employ JOIN clauses to effectively combine data from multiple tables.
    
+ Leverage scalar functions (string, mathematical, date, and conversion) for data manipulation.
    
+ Utilize aggregate functions to summarize data sets.
    
+ Craft subqueries for nested queries and complex data retrieval.
    
+ Develop user-defined functions for reusability and code optimization.

***- Design and Implement Databases:***

Flowers_Store_Project demonstrates the creation of a complete database for a flower shop.

This project includes:

+ Table creation for efficient data storage.
  
+ Populating the tables with relevant sample data.
  
+ A view to display the top 5 most sold flowers.
